Yes.  In general everytime architectures have to provide the prototype
and not just the implementation of something we end up with a giant mess
sooner or later.  In a few cases that is still warranted due to
performance concerns, but i don't think that is the case here.

In that case add a flag for the differing behavior.  And only add them
when actually needed.  And either way there is absolutely no need to
reserve ranges.
