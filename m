This is a great suggestion Xiaoming, much appreciated!
I feel like reinventing the wheel here - with your idea, code was super
clear and concise, very nice suggestion!!

The only 2 things that diverge from your idea: I'm using '%ps' (not
showing offsets) and also, kept the wording "(un)registered/calling",
not using __func__ - I feel it's a bit odd in the output.
OK for you?

I'm definitely using your idea in V2 heh
Cheers,


Guilherme
