I believe that Peter Zijlstra had a special spin lock for NMIs or early
printk, where it would not block if the lock was held on the same CPU. That
is, if an NMI happened and paniced while this lock was held on the same
CPU, it would not deadlock. But it would block if the lock was held on
another CPU.
