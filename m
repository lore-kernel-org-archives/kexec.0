Pingfan has got a machine to reproduce the kexec breakage issue, and
applying these two patches fix it. He planned to paste the test result.
I will ask him to try this branch if he has time, or I can get his
machine to test.

Junichi, also have a try on Boris's branch in NEC's test environment?

Thanks
