As discussed in the other other reply, it seems that both affected
notifiers do not store kernel logs and should stay in the "hypervisor".

I just want to point out that the above idea has problems.
Notifiers storing kernel log need to be treated as kmsg_dump().
In particular, we would  need to know if there are any.
We do not need to call "info" notifier list before kdump
when there is no kernel log dumper registered.
