Also with improvement on KASLR memory randomization, I don't think we
should assume memory sections by looking at PT_LOAD first entries. We
will certainly try to randomize the order. That's why I thought
clearly indicating which VA define which memory section was a good
idea.

I also want to find a time proof approach where we can use it no
matter the changes to KASLR.
