Hi Evan, thanks for your feedback, much appreciated!
What I've done in other cases like this was to have a helper checking
the spinlock in the panic notifier - if we can acquire that, go ahead
but if not, bail out. For a proper example of an implementation, check
patch 13 of the series:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220427224924.592546-14-gpiccoli at igalia.com/ .

Do you agree with that, or prefer really a parameter in
gsmi_shutdown_reason() ? I'll follow your choice =)

My feeling is that this is a good change, indeed - a lot of places are
getting changed like this, in this series.

Reasoning: the problem with your example is that, by default, secondary
CPUs are disabled in the panic path, through an IPI mechanism. IPIs take
precedence and interrupt the work in these CPUs, effectively
interrupting the "polite work" with the lock held heh

Then, such CPU is put to sleep and we finally reach the panic notifier
hereby discussed, in the main CPU. If the other CPU was shut-off *with
the lock held*, it's never finishing such work, so the lock is never to
be released. Conclusion: the spinlock can't be acquired, hence we broke
the machine (which is already broken, given it's panic) in the path of
this notifier.
This should be really rare, but..possible. So I think we should protect
against this scenario.

We can grab others' feedback if you prefer, and of course you have the
rights to refuse this change in the gsmi code, but from my
point-of-view, I don't see any advantage in just assume the risk,
specially since the change is very very simple.

Cheers,


Guilherme
