Currently, the arch_kexec_post_{alloc,free}_pages() unconditionally
maps the kexec area as decrypted. This works fine when SME is active.
Because in SME, the first kernel is loaded in decrypted area by the
BIOS, so the second kernel must be also loaded into the decrypted
memory.

When SEV is active, the first kernel is loaded into the encrypted
area, so the second kernel must be also loaded into the encrypted
memory. Lets make sure that arch_kexec_post_{alloc,free}_pages()
does not clear the memory encryption mask from the kexec area when
SEV is active.
