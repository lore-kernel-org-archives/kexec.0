Sorry, Thomas. I didn't realize these are also required other than
Makedumpfile. So just revert it after we use a new way to get
page_offset and translate VA to PA by page table in makedumpfile. For
the time being they are not needed any more by makedumpfile.

While from below discussion we can see Atsushi, maintainer of
Makedumpfile, still worry about the parsing PT_LOAD segment header way.
I personally think exporting them is easier and more understandable for
user space utility.

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/kexec/2016-December/017815.html

I can't think of other way for your tool, maybe page_offset you can
use the similar way makedumpfile is taking. As for VMALLOC_START and
VMEMMAP_START, it could be necessary. And if you are planning to
randomize the memory section order, thinking about them carefully
now is a good chance lest they need be adjusted again later. 

Sorry again for this.
