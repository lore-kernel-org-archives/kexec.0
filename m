Hi Baoquan, thanks! I'm glad you're also reviewing that =)

I'd like to understand better why the crash_kexec() must always be the
first thing in your use case. If we keep that behavior, we'll see all
sorts of workarounds - see the last patches of this series, Hyper-V and
PowerPC folks hardcoded "crash_kexec_post_notifiers" in order to force
execution of their relevant notifiers (like the vmbus disconnect,
specially in arm64 that has no custom machine_crash_shutdown, or the
fadump case in ppc). This led to more risk in kdump.

The thing is: with the notifiers' split, we tried to keep only the most
relevant/necessary stuff in this first list, things that ultimately
should improve kdump reliability or if not, at least not break it. My
feeling is that, with this series, we should change the idea/concept
that kdump must run first nevertheless, not matter what. We're here
trying to accommodate the antagonistic goals of hypervisors that need
some clean-up (even for kdump to work) VS. kdump users, that wish a
"pristine" system reboot ASAP after the crash.

Cheers,


Guilherme
