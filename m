There is a risk that this lock might become a big kernel lock.

This special lock would need to be used even during normal
system operation. It does not make sense to suddenly start using
another lock during panic.

So I think that we should think twice before using it.
I would prefer using trylock of the original lock when
possible during panic.

It is possible that I miss something.
