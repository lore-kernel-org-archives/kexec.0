Over the past decade least three independently authored patches have come up with the same name for this option. Nobody ever suggested a name where people have to remember whether it has _ or - in it.

Either is accepted. From Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.rst:

Special handling
----------------

Hyphens (dashes) and underscores are equivalent in parameter names, so::

	log_buf_len=1M print-fatal-signals=1

can also be entered as::

	log-buf-len=1M print_fatal_signals=1

The same reason bootloaders like grub have an "initrd" command to load the external cpio.gz for initramfs when it's not statically linked into the kernel image: the delivery mechanism is the same, the kernel inspects the file type to determine how to handle it. This new option _isn't_ legacy, and "rootfs" is already common parlance, so it seemed obvious to everyone with even moderate domain familiarity what to call it.)

Thanks for the explanations.

> P.S. It's a pity lkml.iu.edu and spinics.net are both down right now, but after vger.kernel.org deleted all reference to them I can't say I'm surprised. Neither lkml.org nor lore.kernel.org have an obvious threaded interface allowing you to find stuff without a keyword search, and lore.kernel.org somehow manages not to list "linux-kernel" in its top level list of "inboxes" at all. The wagons are circled pretty tightly...
Yep, they down for me also. :(
linux-kernel is called lkml of lore. It would be nice if they were synonyms.
If you go to https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/, you can use the search box to look for
"s:rootfsflags" or just use a browser's Search (usually Ctrl-F) to search for
"rootflags". Then the email thread is visible.
Or just do a huge $search_engine search for something close to
the $Subject -- or some text from the body of the message. But you probably
know all of this.


If you go to lkml.org and click on "Last 100 messages", then scroll down to
	Re: [PATCH v2] fs: Add 'rootfsflags' to set rootfs mount options	Rob Landley
you can read the email thread for this message (see left side panel).
Or you can find it by date (if you have any idea what the date was).

cheers.
