Hi Evan, thanks for the prompt response! So, I'll proceed like I did in
s390, for consistency.

Well, in the old path without "crash_kexec_post_notifiers", we indeed
end-up relying on native_stop_other_cpus() for x86 as you said, and the
"1s rule" makes sense. But after this series (or even before, if the
kernel parameter "crash_kexec_post_notifiers" was used) the function
used to stop CPUs in the panic path is crash_smp_send_stop(), and the
call chain is like:

Main CPU:
crash_smp_send_stop()
--kdump_nmi_shootdown_cpus()
----nmi_shootdown_cpus()

Then, in each CPU (except the main one, running panic() path),
we execute kdump_nmi_callback() in NMI context.

So, we seem to indeed interrupt any context (even with IRQs disabled),
increasing the likelihood of the potential lockups due to stopped CPUs
holding the locks heheh

Thanks again for the good discussion, let me know if anything I'm saying
doesn't make sense - this crash path is a bit convoluted, specially in
x86, I might have understood something wrongly =)
Cheers,


Guilherme
