Definitely, I agree - it's logical, since we want more info in the logs,
and happens some notifiers running in the informational list do that,
like ftrace_on_oops for example.

Totally agree, these percentages are just an example, 50% is ridiculous
low reliability in my example heheh

But some notifiers deep dive in abstraction layers (like regmap or GPIO
stuff) and it's hard to determine the probability of a lock issue (take
a spinlock already taken inside regmap code and live-lock forever, for
example). These are better to run, if possible, later than kdump or even
info list.

Thanks again for the good analysis Petr!
Cheers,


Guilherme
