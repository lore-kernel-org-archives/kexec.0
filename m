Many changes compared to version 6, so I decided to send it out now.
James Morse raised an important issue to which I do not have a solution
yet. But would like to discuss it.

James wrote:
You can't do this with the page table helpers. We support platforms
with no memory in range of TTBR0's VA space. See dd006da21646f

You will need some idmapped memory to turn the MMU off on a system
that booted at EL1. This will need to be in a set of page tables
that the helpers can't easily touch - so it should only be a single
page. (like the arch code's existing idmap - although that may
have been overwritten).

(I have a machine where this is a problem, if I get the time I will
have a stab at making hibernate's safe page idmaped).
---

As I understand, there are platforms where TTBR0 cannot include all
physical memory for idmap. However, kexec must have at least one page
idmapped (kimage->control_code_page) to be able to relocate kernel
while MMU is enabled:

I am still trying to fully understand the problem:
CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS must be smaller than 48 and physical memory must
start at a high address for this problem to occur.

Why can't we simply decrease T0SZ to cover all physical memory?

v6:
	- Sync with mainline tip
	- Added Acked's from Dave Young
v5:
	- Addressed comments from Matthias Brugger: added review-by's, improved
	  comments, and made cleanups to swsusp_arch_resume() in addition to
	  create_safe_exec_page().
	- Synced with mainline tip.
v4:
	- Addressed comments from James Morse.
	- Split "check pgd table allocation" into two patches, and moved to
	  the beginning of series  for simpler backport of the fixes.
	  Added "Fixes:" tags to commit logs.

	- Added Reviewed-by's
	- Moved "add PUD_SECT_RDONLY" earlier in series to be with other
	  clean-ups
	- Added "Derived from:" to arch/arm64/mm/trans_pgd.c

	- Changed .trans_alloc_page assumption to return zeroed page.
	- Simplify changes to trans_pgd_map_page(), by keeping the old

	  code.
	- Removed: "add trans_pgd_create_empty"
	- replace init_mm with NULL, and keep using non "__" version of
	  populate functions.
v3:
	- Split changes to create_safe_exec_page() into several patches for
	  easier review as request by Mark Rutland. This is why this series
	  has 3 more patches.
	- Renamed trans_table to tans_pgd as agreed with Mark. The header
	  comment in trans_pgd.c explains that trans stands for
	  transitional page tables. Meaning they are used in transition
	  between two kernels.
v2:
	- Fixed hibernate bug reported by James Morse
	- Addressed comments from James Morse:
	  * More incremental changes to trans_table
	  * Removed TRANS_FORCEMAP
	  * Added kexec reboot data for image with 380M in size.

Enable MMU during kexec relocation in order to improve reboot performance.

If kexec functionality is used for a fast system update, with a minimal
downtime, the relocation of kernel + initramfs takes a significant portion
of reboot.

The reason for slow relocation is because it is done without MMU, and thus
not benefiting from D-Cache.

Performance data
----------------
For this experiment, the size of kernel plus initramfs is small, only 25M.
If initramfs was larger, than the improvements would be greater, as time
spent in relocation is proportional to the size of relocation.

Previously:
kernel shutdown	0.022131328s
relocation	0.440510736s
kernel startup	0.294706768s

Relocation was taking: 58.2% of reboot time

Now:
kernel shutdown	0.032066576s
relocation	0.022158152s
kernel startup	0.296055880s

Now: Relocation takes 6.3% of reboot time

Total reboot is x2.16 times faster.

With bigger userland (fitImage 380M), the reboot time is improved by 3.57s,
and is reduced from 3.9s down to 0.33s

reserve space for kexec to avoid relocation, involves changes to generic code
to optimize a problem that exists on arm64 only:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190716165641.6990-1-pasha.tatashin@soleen.com
The first attempt to enable MMU, some bugs that prevented performance
improvement. The page tables unnecessary configured idmap for the whole
physical space.
